                            <p>Born in Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire (the same
                                as Lewis Hamilton)
                                I grew up in the garden-city called Letchworth in North Hertfordshire, England. I can
                                recall spending time
                                with my family and friends, sometimes playing my older brother's acoustic guitar when I
                                was allowed, well,
                                more like playing a toy than actually playing an instrument. However, by the age of 10 I
                                was getting into
                                quite a lot of trouble at school which was causing me problems at home as I would tend
                                to have a lot of
                                meltdowns. I wasn't a bad child according to my mum and dad, but I was having a lot of
                                problems expressing
                                my emotions in a constructive way. I was more DESTRUCTIVE, if you know what I mean.</p>
                            <p>Just before I started secondary school I was diagnosed with
                                Attention Deficit
                                Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and
                                High-Function Autism. To help cope with these, I started drum lessons at the
                                Letchworth
                                Drum Studio around the
                                corner from my house. My mum and dad thought that 'drumming-out' my frustrations
                                might
                                be a good way
                                to relieve some anger and stress. This worked for about a year until I got to the
                                point
                                of not enjoying it
                                as much as when I first started so I gave it up for a while and thatâ€™s when I fell
                                back
                                into trouble. As it
                                helped me out the first-time, I went back to drumming. It was like riding a bike.
                            </p>
                            <p>Another year went past and I didn't feel the need to play drums
                                anymore so instead I
                                started to learn guitar
                                (properly this time). I enjoyed the occasional jamming sessions with my Dad and
                                Grandad
                                Peter or my Uncle Ron who
                                all play guitar.</p>
                            <p>When I first started playing guitar I was 13 and I would
                                practice every day by
                                watching
                                either youtube videos or
                                playing along with my favourite guitarist, Ed Sheeran. I even had my own youtube
                                channel
                                and was in a band at
                                school. Unfortunately, I could only play four chords at the time and the other band
                                members wanted me to play
                                songs I didn't know the chords for which caused arguments. Eventually I left the
                                band
                                and carried on my practice
                                at home.</p>

                            <h2 id="my-guitars"><i class="fas fa-guitar"></i> My Guitars</h2>
                            <p>As a present for my hard work, my Grandad Peter bought me my
                                first electric guitar
                                along
                                with a strap, tuner and
                                little practice <a href="https://www.avsl.com/brands/chord">'Chord'</a> brand amplifier
                                (which I still use today).</p>
                            <p>I had seen in a local music shop window the exact guitar
                                that I wanted in a light
                                blue
                                (as blue is my favourite color)
                                and this guitar looked like a Fender Stratocaster which is the guitar shape my
                                Grandad
                                Peter plays. However, when I
                                looked closer it was actually a <a href="https://www.avsl.com/brands/chord">'Chord'</a>
                                brand guitar in the shape
                                of a Stratocaster. Even better really because the price in the window was fairly
                                cheap.
                            </p>
                            <p>When my Grandad said he would buy it for me I was really
                                excited. MY FIRST GUITAR!
                                One
                                that was mine, not borrowed
                                from my brother or the school! So, on the first Saturday we were all able to get
                                together, myself, Dad and Grandad
                                Peter went into the shop and bought the guitar combo deal. I've played that guitar
                                for
                                hours-upon-hours since then.</p>
                            <p>About 2 years after, my sister-in-law had found both her
                                Casio keyboard (with stand)
                                and
                                half-size acoustic guitar
                                which she offered to give to me if I wanted them. I said yes and now had two guitars
                                to
                                learn on: my electric and
                                this acoustic. I learned to play the keyboard for a short-while but didn't enjoy it as
                                much as guitar so it was put away in the loft.</p>
                            <p>After a few years I wanted to buy an electro-acoustic guitar
                                like the
                                one Ed Sheeran plays, which is
                                a Martin & Co. LX Ed Sheeran Signature. However they were a bit too expensive so I
                                saved
                                up and settled on the LX 1E
                                standard model instead and eventually sold the other acoustic guitar. The Martin looks
                                fantastic and plays beautifully.</p>
                            <p>Since my last year of school I have been writing my own
                                songs and all of these I use
                                my
                                Martin to play on when I
                                record the songs.</p>
                            <p>So I mainly use two guitars for all my practice and recordings:</p>
                            <p>1. Martin & Co. LX 1E Small Body Electro-acoustic guitar with pre-amp pickup.</p>
                            <p>2. Chord Stratocaster Electric Guitar with 3 single-pole pickups</p>

                            <h2 id="my-equipment"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> My Equipment</h2>
                            <p>I was bought an Apple MacBook Air Laptop for my 16th
                                birthday which has software on
                                it
                                called 'Garage Band'. I started
                                to learn how to use this software in my last year of secondary school and used that
                                knowledge to play, sing, record
                                and produce my own songs. I can't really sing but auto-tune is a god-send! <i
                                    class="far fa-smile"></i>.</p>
                            <p>At first, I was recording my voice and guitar on separate
                                tracks through a microphone
                                on
                                my gaming-headphones but
                                although this worked it wasn't ideal. After a visit to my Grandad Peter's house, we
                                explored his music room and Dad
                                showed me how to setup Grandad's 8-channel Behringer Xenyx mixer. This was great fun
                                because he also showed me how
                                to use EQ tricks to make my guitar sound like a bass and record it into my songs. I
                                enjoyed that so much, I decided
                                to buy myself a 2-channel Behringer Xenxy mixer and borrowed one of Grandad's Shure
                                SM58
                                mics and mic stand.</p>
                            <p>Since getting a desk in my bedroom I have used an old tv
                                to link up via HDMI to my
                                laptop
                                and plugged everything else
                                in around the desk. It feels like my own little recording studio!</p>
                            <p>So, in summary, here's the list of my equipment:</p>
                            <p>1. 'Shure' SM58 Microphone with on/off switch</p>
                            <p>2. Standard XLR Balanced lead</p>
                            <p>3. Standard 4-point adjustment tri-pod Microphone stand</p>
                            <p>4. Behringer Xenyx 2-channel mixer with USB output</p>
                            <p>5. Apple MacBook Air with Garage Band App</p>
                            <p>6. 'Chord' 10 watt practice amplifier</p>
