### This is the one and only official site for all things related to Ewan James' music.

Ewan is my son and an aspiring musician who writes, produces and plays his own original songs. Although present on some social media sites, he wanted me to design him a website to channel all these mediums in one place and begin building up his name and brand. From his website, a visitor can signup for exclusive email updates, find the latest gig locations and dates, buy tickets, download the latest music by Ewan James, see pictures from his musical journey or watch his latest youtube videos.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

* HTML5 - This was used to create the 'shell' or main structure of each webpage.
* CSS3 - Cascading Stylesheets to create the look of the site such as colours, typography and image display.
* Bootstrap V4.6 - Styling plugins to speed up the process of coding and add 'straight-out-of-the-box' code for specific features of the webpages.
* Font Awesome V5.15.2 - This link is for adding icons to the webpages.


## TESTING:

I created 2 spreadhsheets to maintaint continuous testing throughout the course of creating this project. The first is a spreadsheet I created for logging small tests after each code or feature change. The second was a more detailed spreadsheet designed to test the validity of the code on each page and also the responsiveness on multiple different viewing platforms and web browsers.
